## About Me

<p style="font-size:110%;">Greetings! I am Xinzhe Yang (杨欣哲) from Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China, currently a Master student in Materials Science at <strong>Peking University</strong>, advised by <a href="http://en.pkusam.cn/">Prof. Feng Pan</a>. I obtained my B.Sc. in Chemistry from <strong>Xiamen University</strong> in 2022, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cheng-group.net/">Prof. Jun Cheng</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;">My research primarily focuses on theoretical investigations of electrochemical interfaces, particularly delving into their dynamic properties under realistic reaction conditions. I also have a broad interest in first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations within the realms of chemistry and materials science.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"><em>Feel free to reach me via email for any discussions, collaborations, or just to say hello. I am in the process of preparing to apply for Fall 2025 Ph.D. programs worldwide.</em></p>
