## About Me

<p style="font-size:110%;">Greetings! Welcome to my homepage.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;">I am Xinzhe Yang (杨欣哲) from Wuxi, China. Currently I am a Master student in Materials Science at <strong>Peking University</strong>, advised by <a href="http://en.pkusam.cn/">Prof. Feng Pan</a>. Prior to this, I obtained my B.Sc. in Chemistry from <strong>Xiamen University</strong> in 2022, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cheng-group.net/">Prof. Jun Cheng</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;">I have a keen interest in employing first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics within the broad fields of chemistry and materials science. My current research primarily revolves around theoretical investigations of electrochemical interfaces, with a specific focus on understanding their dynamic properties under realistic reaction conditions. Based on simulation results, I try to reveal the critical role of interfacial water and cation in various electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about accelerating molecular dynamics through machine learning potentials to enable large-scale simulations.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"><em>Feel free to reach me via email for discussions, collaborations, or just to say hello. I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for the Fall 2025 admission.</em></p>
