## About Me

<p style="font-size:110%;">Greetings! I am Xinzhe Yang (杨欣哲) from Wuxi, China. I am pursuing my Master degree in Materials Science at <strong>Peking University</strong>, advised by <a href="http://en.pkusam.cn/">Prof. Feng Pan</a>. Prior to this, I obtained my B.Sc. in Chemistry from <strong>Xiamen University</strong> in 2022, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cheng-group.net/">Prof. Jun Cheng</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;">My current research primarily revolves around theoretical investigations of electrochemical interfaces, with a specific focus on understanding their dynamic properties under realistic reaction conditions. I also have a keen interest in employing first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations within the broad fields of chemistry and materials science.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"><em>Feel free to reach me via email for discussions, collaborations, or just to say hello. I am in the process of preparing applications for Ph.D. programs worldwide, aiming for admission in Fall 2025.</em></p>
