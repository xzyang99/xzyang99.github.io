## About Me

Greetings! I am Xinzhe Yang (杨欣哲) from Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China, currently a Master student in Materials Science at **Peking University**, advised by [Prof. Feng Pan](http://www.pkusam.cn/). I obtained my B.Sc. in Chemistry from **Xiamen University** in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Cheng](https://www.cheng-group.net/).

My research primarily focuses on theoretical investigations of electrochemical interfaces, particularly delving into their dynamic properties under realistic reaction conditions. I also have a broad interest in first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations within the realms of chemistry and materials science.

*Feel free to reach me via email for any discussions, collaborations, or just to say hello. I am in the process of preparing to apply for Fall 2025 Ph.D. programs worldwide.*
